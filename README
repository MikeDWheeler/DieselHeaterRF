Simple class for Arduino to control an inexpensive Chinese diesel heater through 443 MHz RF by using a TI CC1101 transceiver.
Replicates the protocol used by the four button "red LCD remote" with an OLED screen, and should probably work if your heater supports this type of remote controller.

Happy hacking!
