Simple library for Arduino to control an inexpensive Chinese diesel heater through 433 MHz RF by using a TI CC1101 transceiver.

Replicates the protocol used by the four button "red LCD remote" with an OLED screen, and should probably work if your heater supports this type of remote controller.

You will need an ESP32 and TI CC1101 transceiver.

I used an Ebyte E07-M1101S, but there are many different breakout modules that should also work.

Connect the SPI bus and GDO2 as follows:

    ESP32         CC1101
    -----         ------
    4   <-------> GDO2
    18  <-------> SCK
    3v3 <-------> VCC
    23  <-------> MOSI
    19  <-------> MISO
    5   <-------> CSn
    GND <-------> GND

Happy hacking!
